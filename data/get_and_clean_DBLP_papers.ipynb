Specifically, if the section header for a paper contains particular keywords (for example \"demo\" or \"poster\", see code for full list) then that paper will be excluded. Not all venues are divided into sections on DBLP and in cases where there are papers without section headers, all such papers are included.\n",

The pagination which is pulled from the webpage HTML and stored as a string is parsed into a start and end page number. Using these numbers, the length of the papers is determined and papers are included if they meet a minimum page length. The *keep_missing* and (k) in the function name and legend label for this filter refer to the method used for dealing with papers for which pagination information could not be validly formatted into a start and end page. In this instance, papers without valid pagination are included (i.e. are not removed by the filter).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```filter_by_header_and_page_number_keep_missing``` 'Header + Page Num (k)': This method first applies the ```filter_by_header``` method described above, and then applies the ```filter_by_page_number_keep_missing``` method to the remaining papers. This means that the resulting papers are the intersection of the papers that pass each of these filtering methods.\n",
